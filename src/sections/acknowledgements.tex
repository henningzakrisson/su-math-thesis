First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor
Main Supervisor for her invaluable guidance and support throughout the course of this research.
Without her expertise and encouragement, this work would not have been possible.
I would also like to thank my co-supervisor Coco Supervisor for helping me get the best office
space in the department, and for providing me with the necessary resources to carry out my research.

I am grateful to my colleagues at the Department of Mathematics for their support and
encouragement, and for creating a stimulating research environment.
Especially, I want to thank Office Matesson for all the fun and games at the after-works, and for
always being there to help me with my code.
Also, a shoutout to Printer Fixerdaughter for supporting me in my darkest hours, and for
always making sure that the printer was working when I needed it the most.

I would like to thank my family for their unwavering support and love, and for always
believing in me.
Finally, I would like to thank my partner for their understanding,
and for always being there for me when I needed it the most.
This thesis would not have been possible without you.
