The universal math equation that is the basis of solving all the problems in the universe is given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:universal_math_equation}
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \, dx = \sqrt{\pi}.
\end{equation}
This equation is the foundation of all the papers in this thesis, and has been used to solve every
known mathematical problem to date, including the ones presented by \textcite[Chapter 3]{smith1987very}.

In Figure~\ref{fig:universal_math_figure}, you can find a very nice figure that illustrates an
important structure that is relevant to the universal math equation in Equation~\eqref{eq:universal_math_equation}.
