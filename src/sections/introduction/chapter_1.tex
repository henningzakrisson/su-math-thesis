This thesis is about solving every known mathematical problem to date.
Through the integration of advanced computational techniques, innovative algorithms, and a deep understanding
of mathematical principles, this work transcends centuries of mathematical challenges, offering solutions to
problems that have perplexed scholars since the inception of mathematics as a discipline.

The introductory part of this thesis is organized as follows:
Chapter~\ref{ch:second_chapter_label} presents some underlying theory.
After the introductory part, the four papers are presented in Part~\ref{part:papers}.
