This section covers some more fundamental theory on the topic of the thesis.
Mainly, it will cover the theory presented in many previous works.

A mathematician is a person who can calculate things~\parencite{wang2019cutting}.
That is good.

In Algorithm~\ref{alg:universal_algorithm}, a very fun algorithm is presented.
