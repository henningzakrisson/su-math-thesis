This thesis is based on two papers, numbered I--II, which are included
in the following order.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*.]
   \item \fullciteall{supervisor2020universal}
   
   \item \fullciteall{researcher2021complete}

   \item \fullciteall{emeritus2023infinite}
   
   \item \fullciteall{doctorow2023multidimensional}

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Authors' contributions:}
In Paper I, D. Doctorow developed the Universal Solution Algorithm (USA) and wrote the paper.
M. Supervisor was just there for the ride.

In Paper II, D. Doctorow developed the Complete Theory of Everything (CTE) and wrote the paper, as well
as implementing the theory in the \texttt{python} package \texttt{cte}.
P. Researcher was included as an author in order to make the paper more credible, and remains
unclear why E. Colleague was included as an author.

In Paper III, D. Doctorow did not do much, but helped O. Emeritus to write the paper on a computer and was therefore
included as an author.
